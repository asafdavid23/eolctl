# End of Life Control (eolctl)

`eolctl` is a command-line tool that helps developers and system administrators manage and monitor the end-of-life (EOL) status of various software products. This tool queries the [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date/) API to provide real-time information about software versions and their support lifecycle.

## Features

- Check the EOL status of various programming languages and frameworks.
- Export to a JSON file.
- Scan your code project (GO and Python only supported for now.)
- Get a custom range for versions.
- Compare between existing and future version
